<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1"></a>[1]</span></p>

<p class="p4">It is eminently fitting that the Nation’s
illustrious men, the men who
loom as heroes before the eyes of our
people, should be fittingly commemorated
here at the National Capital, and
I am glad indeed to take part in the
unveiling of this statue to General
Sheridan. His name will always stand
high on the list of American worthies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Not only was he a great general, but he
showed his greatness with that touch of
originality which we call genius. Indeed
this quality of brilliance has been in one
sense a disadvantage to his reputation, for
it has tended to overshadow his solid
ability. We tend to think of him only as
the dashing cavalry leader, whereas he
was in reality not only that, but also a
great commander. Of course, the fact in
his career most readily recognized was his
mastery in the necessarily modern art of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
handling masses of modern cavalry so as
to give them the fullest possible effect,
not only in the ordinary operations of
cavalry which precede and follow a battle,
but in the battle itself. But in addition he
showed in the civil war that he was a
first-class army commander, both as a
subordinate of Grant and when in independent
command. His record in the
Valley campaign, and again from Five
Forks to Appomattox, is one difficult to
parallel in military history. After the close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of the great war, in a field where there was
scant glory to be won by the general in
chief, he rendered a signal service which has
gone almost unnoticed; for in the tedious
weary Indian wars on the Great Plains
it was he who developed in thorough-going
fashion the system of campaigning
in winter, which, at the cost of bitter
hardship and peril, finally broke down
the banded strength of those formidable
warriors, the horse Indians.</p>
</div>

<p>His career was typically American, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
from plain beginnings he rose to the
highest military position in our land.
We honor his memory itself; and moreover,
as in the case of the other great
commanders of his day, his career symbolizes
the careers of all those men who
in the years of the nation’s direst need
sprang to the front to risk everything,
including life itself, and to spend the days
of their strongest young manhood in
valorous conflict for an ideal. Often we
Americans are taunted with having only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
a material ideal. The empty folly of the
taunt is sufficiently shown by the presence
here to-day of you men of the Grand
Army, you the comrades of the dead
general, the men who served with and
under him. In all history we have no
greater instance of subordination of self,
of the exalting of a lofty ideal over
merely material well-being among the
people of a great nation, than was shown
by our own people in the civil war.</p>

<p>And you, the men who wore the blue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
would be the first to say that this same
lofty indifference to the things of the body,
when compared to the things of the soul,
was shown by your brothers who wore the
gray. Dreadful was the suffering, dreadful
the loss, of the civil war. Yet it
stands alone among wars in this, that, now
that the wounds are healed, the memory
of the mighty deeds of valor performed
on one side no less than on the other has
become the common heritage of all our
people in every quarter of this country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
The completeness with which this is true
is shown by what is occurring here to-day.
We meet together to raise a monument
to a great Union general, in the presence
of many of the survivors of the Union
Army; and the Secretary of War, the man
at the head of the Army, who, by virtue
of his office, occupies a special relation to
the celebration, is himself a man who
fought in the Confederate service. Few
indeed have been the countries where such
a conjunction would have been possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and blessed indeed are we that in our own
beloved land it is not only possible, but
seems so entirely natural as to excite no
comment whatever.</p>

<p>There is another point in General
Sheridan’s career which it is good for
all of us to remember. Whereas Grant,
Sherman, and Thomas were of the old
native American stock, the parents of
Sheridan, like the parents of Farragut,
were born on the other side of the water.
Any one of the five was just as much a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
type of the real American, of what is best
in America, as the other four. We should
keep steadily before our minds the fact
that Americanism is a question of principle,
of purpose, of idealism, of character;
that it is not a matter of birthplace, or
creed, or line of descent. Here in this
country the representatives of many old-world
races are being fused together into
a new type, a type the main features of
which are already determined, and were
determined at the time of the Revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
war; for the crucible in which all the new
types are melted into one was shaped
from 1776 to 1789, and our nationality
was definitely fixed in all its essentials
by the men of Washington’s day. The
strains will not continue to exist separately
in this country as in the old world.
They will be combined in one; and of
this new type those men will best represent
what is loftiest in the nation’s past,
what is finest in her hope for the future,
who stand each solely on his worth as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
a man; who scorn to do evil to others,
and who refuse to submit to wrongdoing
themselves; who have in them no taint
of weakness; who never fear to fight
when fighting is demanded by a sound
and high morality, but who hope by
their lives to bring ever nearer the day
when justice and peace shall prevail within
our own borders and in our relations
with all foreign powers.</p>

<p>Much of the usefulness of any career
must lie in the impress that it makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
upon, and the lessons that it teaches to,
the generations that come after. We of
this generation have our own problems
to solve, and the condition of our solving
them is that we shall all work together as
American citizens without regard to differences
of section or creed or birthplace,
copying, not the divisions which so
lamentably sundered our fathers one from
another, but the spirit of burning devotion
to duty which drove them forward,
each to do the right as it was given him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to see the right, in the great years when
Grant, Farragut, Sherman, Thomas, and
Sheridan, when Lee and Jackson, and the
Johnstons, the valiant men of the North
and the valiant men of the South, fought
to a finish the great civil war.
They did not themselves realize, in the
bitterness of the struggle, that the blood
and the grim suffering marked the death
throes of what was worn out, and the birth
pangs of a new and more glorious national
life. Mighty is the heritage which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
have received from the men of the mighty
days. We, in our turn, must gird up our
loins to meet the new issues with the same
stern courage and resolute adherence to
an ideal, which marked our fathers who
belonged to the generation of the man in
whose honor we commemorate this monument
to-day.</p>
